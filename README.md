# Baboucoin

## Introduction
A work in progress cryptocurrency based on Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin.

Baboucoin is a project I began working on in March 2022. The idea behind it was to put my software development skills to practical use, in the form of a cryptocurrency, a subject I've had an interest in for years. As an additional challege, I decided that I would not be looking at any source code, tutorials or examples for existing cryptocurrencies. This project was to be built from scratch through what I learned whilst reading Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin Whitepaper, additional explanations found online and analysis of Bitcoin blockchain explorers.

Before this project, I hadn't spent much time using Python, I knew the basics but had never created a full project with it. I chose this language because of the large collection of built-in modules and the ease of installation of additional modules.
